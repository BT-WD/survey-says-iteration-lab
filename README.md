# Survey Says - JavaScript Iteration Lab

## The Goal

The information in the database file attached here has results from a survey Jeff took of some of his friends. He's going to use that information to learn some things about the friends who answered the survey. For example:
* What percent of his friends are programmers?
* Do they like similar or dissimilar music?
* How many of them live in each state?

One warning: these are real people, and real people don't always provide the easiest data to work with. Get ready for typos, unexpected blanks, and outright silliness (Max, for example, isn't 100 years old).

In the challenge.js file, Jeff has written some questions he has. Use your knowledge of for loops and the map method to complete these challenge!

## Getting Started

Open index.html in a web browser and open the console. Then, open the challenges.js and get started!
